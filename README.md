# Hash-Table-Project




This Python project aims to create a hash table system with various operations such as calculating hash values, mapping items to the table, inserting new items, deleting items based on keys, and finding items efficiently among other things. Additionally, the project includes functionalities for logging user login events and tracking user sessions. The system generates session IDs to track user sessions, allowing it to determine if a user was online during a specific time period. This comprehensive project provides a practical implementation of hash table operations while also incorporating user session tracking features.



Functions I did in this project include: len, _setitem_, _getitem_, _delitem_, _contains_, _hash, _insert, _get, _delete, _grow, update, keys, values, items, clear, add_session, _generate_session_id, generate_session_id_wrapper, was_user_online





NOTE: Rest of the functions were pre-defined and provided to me when completing this project and were not completed or changed by me
